Created with Astro and deployed as a static page to Cloudflare pages.

Useful commands:

```
npm run dev # local webserver for development
npm run build # build it; output dir: dist/
npm run preview # start a webserver that serves dist/ (useful for verification before deployin it)
```

Deployment is automatic by pushing to Github.
